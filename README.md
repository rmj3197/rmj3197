### Hi there, I am Raktim !! 👋

#### I'm a Ph.D. student in  Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering program at State University of New York at Buffalo, United States.

My current research interests lie at the intersection of data science and biomedical/ pharmaceutical sciences. I am a Research Assistant in Dr. Marianthi Markatou’s group and conduct research on statistical machine learning and inference methods to extract knowledge from large and complex data sets. A part of my work is motivated by the search of social determinants of health that can drive better healthcare delivery models. The second part concentrates on developing methods for identifying safety issues associated with the use of medical products.
